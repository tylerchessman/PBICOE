Guidance for establishing a Power BI Center of Excellence

### Summary
There are several publicly available resources that discuss and describe a Center of Excellence (COE) for an enterprise Power BI environment.  This document is intended to introduce these existing resources.  Key pieces of information have been extracted/synthesized to provide a starting point i.e., succinct, practical guidance for defining and implementing a COE.  Suggested action items, along with highlights from an initial (and ongoing) implementation (“case study”), are also included.
